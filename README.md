DotsAndBoxes
============
TDD Exercise for the paper game 'Dots and Boxes'
Source: http://www.papg.com/show?1TMU

Requirements:
“The two players take turns to join two adjacent dots with a horizontal or vertical line. If a player completes the fourth side of a box they now own that box and must draw another line.

When all the boxes have been completed the winner is the player who owns the most boxes.

The game is more complex than it initially appears, and even on a 4×4 grid there is plenty of opportunity for skillful play.”
